OSC Summary
-----------

OSC 1:                                     Pin/Node Value
  OSC Instance Name:                                oscc_0
  OSC Type:                                         OSCC
  OSC Output:                              NODE     clk

ASIC Components
---------------

Instance Name: oscc_0
         Type: OSCC

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'RESET_c'.

GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.

Components with disabled GSR Property
-------------------------------------

These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED. The components will not
     respond to the reset signal 'RESET_c' via the GSR component.

Type and number of components of the type:
   Register = 1

Type and instance name of component:
   Register : CONTROLLINES/V_SYNC_30

Run Time and Memory Usage
-------------------------

   Total CPU Time: 0 secs
   Total REAL Time: 0 secs
   Peak Memory Usage: 33 MB
